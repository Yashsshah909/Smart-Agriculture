# Smart-Agriculture
The increasing demands of many consumers and demand for agricultural products have
stimulated an awareness among farmers that increasing their productivity by implementing
advanced technologies is the best option for the long term in this sector. The most important
aspect that is to be improved is the efficient use of natural resources. Traditional techniques
are very inefficient and cannot keep pace with the increasing demands. Therefore, our paper
outlines techniques that can be implemented to achieve higher yields by using soil moisture
sensor for determining the soil moisture level, pH level sensors to maintain proper soil pH
using fertilizers, and others which are connected to a GSM module which is used to send
updates periodically to the farmerâ€™s mobile phone.
Advances in wireless communication technologies have led to the emergence of numerous
engineering projects to meet human needs. As we all know, agriculture plays a significant
role in developing countries such as India and the implementation of mobile communication
to facilitate farmers is the basic idea of our project.

The field is monitored by 4 parameters, Soil moisture, pH value, temperature,
and humidity. For these parameters, we will have sensors that will read the data from the field
and then send it to our controller, Arduino. The controller will then compare the values to the
user-specified threshold value. In case the value read by the sensor does not satisfy the required
values, then a signal will be sent to the relay board. To maintain the soil moisture level, we will
have a 3-phase motor to start the flow of water in the field. Similarly, the system will have a
fertilization system to satisfy the pH value of the soil and a fan or some kind of ventilation
system to control the temperature and humidity. The system will monitor these values from the
field continuously and would stop the signal to the relay board when we get the optimum
values.

Further, for monitoring purposes we have integrated 2 systems, firstly, an LCD screen that can be attached anywhere in the vicinity of the field, like the gate or in the house of the farmer as well, the system is programmed in a way that we can decide what kind of information the farmer needs to check about his field, this includes the status of the pumps and the data from the sensors as well. We have also been able to introduce the domain of the telecommunication field with the GSM module. This module is used to send such information to the mobile device of the farmer, the biggest advantage of this system is that this module supports even the basic sim cards and mobile phones which are usually employed by the farmers
