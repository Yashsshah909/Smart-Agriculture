# Smart-Agriculture
The increasing demands of many consumers and demand for agricultural products have
stimulated an awareness among farmers that increasing their productivity by implementing
advanced technologies is the best option for the long term in this sector. The most important
aspect that is to be improved is the efficient use of natural resources. Traditional techniques
are very inefficient and cannot keep pace with the increasing demands. Therefore, our paper
outlines techniques that can be implemented to achieve higher yields by using soil moisture
sensor for determining the soil moisture level, pH level sensors to maintain proper soil pH
using fertilizers, and others which are connected to a GSM module which is used to send
updates periodically to the farmerâ€™s mobile phone.
Advances in wireless communication technologies have led to the emergence of numerous
engineering projects to meet human needs. As we all know, agriculture plays a significant
role in developing countries such as India and the implementation of mobile communication
to facilitate farmers is the basic idea of our project.
